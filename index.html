    <h3>SEALS AND WATERPROOFS ALL KNOWN SPECIALTY CARTRIDGES</h3>

    <p>MARKKRON Custom Bullet and Primer Sealer completely seals and waterproofs cartridge primers, shot shell primers,
        bullet case joints and off the shelf, unsealed, factory ammunition with the option of color marking each
        cartridge
        for instant powder load and cartridge caliber ID.</p>

    <p>An unsealed primer pocket joint invites moisture contamination which can result in misfires and shortened
        cartridge storage life. MARKRON Bullet and Primer Sealer completely seals and waterproofs cartridge
        primers, bullet case joints, and off the shelf unsealed factory ammunition for 100% firing consistency and
        extended
        storage life including up to 30 days total water submersion.</p>

    <p>MARKRON Primer Sealer has undergone rigorous military testing and is used by U.S armament manufacturers as their
        water-proofing sealer of choice.</p>
